# CSharp22Ex01 



 1. write a program that read 3, 7-bit numbers (include validation on the input),
	        parsing the input to decimal numbers (not using the c# built-in function),
	        print them in increased order , how many palindrome? , how many devided by 3?, 
          how many ones/zeros?, what is the total 3 avarage of decimal digits?. 
  
	  
 2. write a program that print this exct shape using recurssion	
             
             '''
              *
             ***
            *****
           *******
          *********
           *******
            *****
             ***
              *
             '''
             
             
3. write a program that print the Diamond from question 2 but in every height the user ask (include input validation) 
		    try use the assembly from question 2. <br/> 
		
4.write a program that the input a 9 char string and give the following feedback:
      
      4.1 is the string is palindrome?
      4.2 if it's a number - is it devided by 3?
      4.3 if it's an eanglish letter only string , how many of them are small letters?
      4.4 pay attention to user input , it should contain only eanglish letters *or* only numbers -> input validation.
          
     
	
	
  5.write a program that read 9 digit wholw number and gives the following feedback: 
		
		5.1 how many digits are smaller than the unit digit? 
		5.2 what is the biggest digit according to user input? 
		5.3 how many numbers divided by 3 ? 
		5.4 what is the mean sum of digits ?
		
		000000123 is also a number . require input validation.
